== Introduction == 

The Middler is a Man in the Middle tool to demonstrate protocol middling
attacks. Led by Jay Beale, the project involves a team of authors including
InGuardians agents Justin Searle and Matt Carpenter, as well as Open Source
non-InGuardians employees Tim Craig and Brandon Edwards.  The Middler is 
intended to man in the middle, or "middle" for short, every protocol for which
we can create code.

In our first alpha release, we released an HTTP proxy built by Matt and Jay, 
with introductory plug-ins by Justin and InGuardians agent Tom Liston.  The
HTTP proxy and plugins have moved into full production state, with a new 
protocol, Voice over IP's own SIP, in development.

The Middler runs on Linux and OS X and requires Python 2.6.x.


== Plug-Ins ==

Justin and Tom's first plug-ins were very cool:

    * plugin-beef.py - inject the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) into any
      HTTP requests originating on the local LAN

    * plugin-metasploit.py - inject an IFRAME into cleartext (HTTP) requests
      that loads Metasploit browser exploits

    * plugin-keylogger.py - inject a JavaScript? onKeyPress event handler to
      cleartext forms that get submitted via HTTPS, forcing the browser to send
      the password character-by-character to the attacker's server, before the
      form is submitted.

Justin has refinements to these on the way, as well as a batch of so-far
unreleased modules.

The author team has done a tremendous amount of research, design and pseudo-code
work, fleshing out attacks on web-based e-mail systems and social networking
sites. We'll be standing up an external Wiki soon to share more of these ideas,
but you can get early details from our slides from Jay and Justin's talks at Def
Con.

== Dependencies: ==

The Middler depends on the following Python modules:

    * scapy
    * libpcap
    * readline
    * libdnet (libdumbnet on some systems where dnet means DECnet.)
    * python-netfilter 

Please see the wiki for platform-specific installation instructions.

=== Special Pre-Announcement: ===

Justin Searle offers a class on Man in the Middle Attacks for Penetration Testers
class, where he teaches people how to both use and add onto the Middler and other
MitM tools.  We're sure you'll find the class very useful.
