== Introduction == 

The Middler is a Man in the Middle tool to demonstrate protocol middling
attacks. Led by Jay Beale, the project involves a team of authors including
InGuardians agents Justin Searle and Matt Carpenter.  The Middler is intended to
man in the middle, or "middle" for short, every protocol for which we can create
code.

In our first alpha release, we released a core built by Matt and Jay, with
introductory plug-ins by Justin and InGuardians agent Tom Liston. It runs on
Linux and Mac OS X, with most of the code functional on Windows and BSD Unix.

The current codebase is in the alpha state, but a beta release is coming soon,
with better documentation (see the wiki), easier installation, and even more
plug-ins, at least if Justin has his way!


== Plug-Ins ==

Justin and Tom's first plug-ins were very cool:

    * plugin-beef.py - inject the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) into any
      HTTP requests originating on the local LAN

    * plugin-metasploit.py - inject an IFRAME into cleartext (HTTP) requests
      that loads Metasploit browser exploits

    * plugin-keylogger.py - inject a JavaScript? onKeyPress event handler to
      cleartext forms that get submitted via HTTPS, forcing the browser to send
      the password character-by-character to the attacker's server, before the
      form is submitted.

Justin has refinements to these on the way, as well as a batch of so-far
unreleased modules.

The author team has done a tremendous amount of research, design and pseudo-code
work, fleshing out attacks on web-based e-mail systems and social networking
sites. We'll be standing up an external Wiki soon to share more of these ideas,
but you can get early details from our slides from Jay and Justin's talks at Def
Con and ShmooCon.

== Dependencies: ==

The Middler depends on the following Python modules:

    * scapy
    * libpcap
    * readline
    * libdnet
    * beautifulsoup

Please see the wiki for platform-specific installation instructions.

=== Special Pre-Announcement: ===

Co-author Justin Searle will begin teaching Middling for Penetration Testers
class this summer, where he'll teach people how to both use and add onto the
Middler and other MitM tools. It promises to be very, very useful.
